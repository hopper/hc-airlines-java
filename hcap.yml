      description: |
        This API is authenticated with OAuth 2, Client Credentials grant. Clients should use their `client_id` and `client_secret` to obtain an `access_token`. The `access_token` should be included in every request, as a `Bearer` token on an `Authorization` header. Note that `access_token`s eventually expire, requiring a new token to be fetched.

        **Token URL**: https://hopper-api.auth0.com/oauth/token

        **Token TTL**: 86400 seconds (1 day)

        **Example Token Request**:

        ```
        curl --request POST --url https://hopper-api.auth0.com/oauth/token --header 'content-type: application/json' --data '{
          "client_id": "<your-client-id>",
          "client_secret": "<your-client-secret>",
          "audience": "<server being accessed, e.g. https://api.hopper.com>",
          "grant_type": "client_credentials"
        }'
        ```

        clientCredentials:
